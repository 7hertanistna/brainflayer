However, getting a CD key for Resident Evil 6 can be tricky, as many online sources are unreliable or illegal.
 
One way to get a CD key for Resident Evil 6 is to use a keygen or a generator. A keygen is a software that creates random CD keys that can be used to activate the game.

Moreover, using a keygen may violate the terms of service of Windows Live and result in your account being banned or suspended.

When you buy the game, you will receive a CD key that you can enter when you launch the game. This way, you can ensure that your CD key is legitimate and safe.

Another issue is the camera, which can sometimes be too close or too far from your character, making it hard to see what is going on or aim properly.
